# 00 Days Left

### Theme

We thought about what repair meant to us, looking at the state of the world today there is so much we can do to make a change and slow down climate change and go towards a better world. Capitalism does help, people and corporations will stop at nothing to make a quick buck, but at what cost? This is a game that involves making as much money as possible before the earth ends. You have 10 choices to make and each choice affects how much money you make and how many days the earth has left to survive. See how much money you have made by the time the earth ends or by the time you run out of chances. The aim of this is to show that you can make financial gains without having to screw over the earth.
